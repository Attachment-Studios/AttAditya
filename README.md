I'm a Pink coloured Pixelated Austrailian Panda who likes sleeping all day and I also live in Mercury.

Just kidding, I'm Attachment Aditya. I like coding and I also own a YouTube channel known as "Attachment Studios". I've made many projects and videos.

Other than that, I personally like Cubing. Although no world records but I have solved many cubes. I have a decent collection of cube, decent because I have a few types of cubes, no repeats but many types of cubes. Another thing I've also been into many other activites. These include robotics, writing, mathematics, arts, music, animations and much more.

You know, I'm pretty talented if you ask me... I mean... Yeah, if we ignore some laziness...
